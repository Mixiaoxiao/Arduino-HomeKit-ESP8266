## Apple HomeKit accessory server library for ESP8266 Arduino

This Arduino library is a native Apple HomeKit accessory implementation for the [ESP8266 Arduino core](https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino), and works without any additional bridges.

This project is mainly based on [esp-homekit](https://github.com/maximkulkin/esp-homekit) for [ESP-OPEN-RTOS](https://github.com/SuperHouse/esp-open-rtos).

I ported the RTOS-based implementation of [esp-homekit](https://github.com/maximkulkin/esp-homekit) to the pure Arduino environment, aimed at easy and fast building project using Arduino IDE (or Eclipse with sloeber, PlatformIO).

Enjoy the "one-key" build, "one-key" upload, and work to link various other Arduino libraries with Apple HomeKit!

Here is a [discussion](https://github.com/HomeACcessoryKid/Arduino-HomeKit/issues/1) about the RTOS is required for running Apple HomeKit, and this project is a proof of concept that Apple HomeKit can be implemented and work fine without the RTOS.

This library is built with ESP8266 Arduino Core 2.6.3. Lower versions may compile with errors.

For ESP32, see [Arduino-HomeKit-ESP32](https://github.com/Mixiaoxiao/Arduino-HomeKit-ESP32). The HomeKit running on ESP32 has a **GREAT PERFORMANCE** which is 10x faster than ESP8266.

## Preview

## Setup code of the example sketch

``111-11-111``


## Usage

1. Define your accessory in a .c file to enjoy the  convenient "Macro" style declaration. You can also define your accessory in a .ino file using C++ code.
	```C
		homekit_accessory_t *accessories[] = ...
		homekit_server_config_t config = {
			.accessories = accessories,
			.password = "111-11-111",
			//.on_event = on_homekit_event, //optional
			//.setupId = "ABCD" //optional
		};
	```
2. In your sketch
	```C
		#include <arduino_homekit_server.h>;
		
		//access the config defined in C code
		extern "C" homekit_server_config_t config; 
		
		void setup() {
			WiFi.begin(ssid, password);
			arduino_homekit_setup(&config);
		}
		
		void loop() {
			arduino_homekit_loop();
		}
	```
Done.

## Performance

Notice: You should set the ESP8266 CPU to run at 160MHz (at least during the pairing process), to avoid the tcp-socket disconnection from iOS device caused by timeout.

* Preinit: ~9.1s (You can see the accessory on your iOS HOME app after Preinit)
* Pair Setup Step 1/3: ~0s (The heavy crypto computation is done in Preinit)
* Pair Setup Step 2/3: ~12.1s 
* Pair Setup Step 3/3: ~0.8s  (The pair-setup is only processed when first paired with iOS device)
* Pair Verify Step 1/2: ~0.3s
* Pair Verify Step 2/2: ~0.8s (The Verify Step is required every time iOS connects or reconnects to ESP8266 to establish secure session)

All pairing process takes ~14s after you input the setup-code on your iPhone. Notice that Preinit require ~9s before you can start to pair.


## Heap (memory)

The heap is critical for ESP8266 with full TCP/IP support. ESP8266 easily crashes when the memory is lower than ~5000.

I tried to make WolfSSL crypto work safely on ESP8266 with better performance and lower memory or a trade-off. See details in next section.

Here are the free heap values of running the example sketch:

* Boot: ~26000
* Preinit over: ~22000
* Pairing: ~17000 (or even low when crypto computing)
* Paired and connected with one iOS device: ~21700
* Paired and no iOS device connected: ~23400

After memory optimization in v1.1.0:

* Boot: ~46000
* Preinit over: ~41000
* Pairing: ~37000 (or even low when crypto computing)
* Paired and connected with one iOS device: ~41700
* Paired and no iOS device connected: ~43000


## WolfSSL

* Based on wolfssl-3.13.0-stable.
* Clean source code: the unused files are removed.
* `CURVE25519_SMALL` and `ED25519_SMALL`: ESP8266 can not directly run without `SMALL` defined since the memory is not sufficient. But the NO `SMALL` version is faster. I mark the big `ge_precomp base[32][8]` with PROGMEM to store it in Flash (around 70KB). Also the `ge_double_scalarmult_vartime` can not run caused by lack of heap. I define `ESP_GE_DOUBLE_SCALARMULT_VARTIME_LOWMEM` in `user_settings.h` to use LOWMEM version of `ge_double_scalarmult_vartime` in `ge_low_mem.c`. This is a trade-off of performance and memory. If you want more Flash space, you should define `CURVE25519_SMALL` and `ED25519_SMALL` and undefine `ESP_GE_DOUBLE_SCALARMULT_VARTIME_LOWMEM` in `user_settings.h` (this will lead the Pair Verify Steps to take 1.2s + 0.9s).
* `integer.c`(big integer operations): `MP_16BIT` and `ESP_FORCE_S_MP_EXPTMOD` are defined for better performance in ESP8266. `ESP_INTEGER_WINSIZE` (value is 3) is defined to avoid crash caused by memory exhaust and the values of {3, 4, 5} are of similar performance.

## Storage

* The pairing data is stored in the `EEPROM` address in ESP8266 Arduino core.
* This project does not use the `EEPROM` library with data-cache to reduce memory use (directly call flash_read and write). 
* The `EEPROM` is 4096B in ESP8266, this project uses max [0, 1408B).
* See the comments in `storge.c` and [ESP8266-EEPROM-doc](https://arduino-esp8266.readthedocs.io/en/2.6.3/libraries.html#eeprom).
* `EEPROM` of [1408, 4096) is safe for you to use. 
* This project do NOT use `FS(file system)`, so you can use `FS` freely.


## WatchDog

* There are software and hardware watchdogs in ESP8266 Arduino core. The heavy crypto computing will lead to watchdog reset.
* There are disable/enable api of software-watchdog in ESP8266 Arduino core.
* I found the [esp_hw_wdt](https://github.com/ComSuite/esp_hw_wdt) to disable/enable the hardware-watchdog.
* The two watchdogs are disabled while `Preinit` and `Pair Setup Step 2/3`.

## Recommended settings in IDE

* Module: Generic ESP8266 Module (to enable full settings)
* FlashSize: at least 470KB for sketch (see `WolfSSL` section if you want a smaller sketch) 
* LwIP Variant: v2 Lower Memory (for lower memory use)
* Debug Level: None (for lower memory use)
* Espressif FW: nonos-sdk 2.2.1+119(191122) (which I used to build this project)
* SSL Support: Basic SSL ciphers (lower ROM use)
* VTables: Flash (does not matter maybe)
* Erase Flash: select `All Flash Contents` when you first upload
* CPU Frequency: 160MHz (must)

## Arduino port

* `ESP8266WiFi` (WiFiServer and WiFiClient) is used for tcp connection.
* `ESP8266mDNS` is used for advertising (Bonjour) 

## Troubleshooting

* Check your serial output with [example_serial_output.txt](https://raw.github.com/Mixiaoxiao/Arduino-HomeKit-ESP8266/master/extras/example_serial_output_v1.1.0.txt)


## Change Log

#### v1.4.0

* Add `yield()` while crypto computing, to prevent WiFi disconnection. The idea is from [BbIKTOP-issues80](https://github.com/Yurik72/ESPHap/issues/80#issuecomment-803685175)
* One new example.

#### v1.3.0

* Small improvements.

#### v1.2.0

* New examples.

#### v1.1.0

* Memory optimization: moved String/byte constants as much as possible to Flash. The `RODATA` section of `bin` is only 4672. Extra ~20K free-heap is available compared with v1.0.1.
* Upload [ESP8266WiFi_nossl_noleak](https://github.com/Mixiaoxiao/Arduino-HomeKit-ESP8266/tree/master/extras/ESP8266WiFi_nossl_noleak/), a `nossl` and `noleak` version of the official `ESP8266WiFi` library of Arduino Core 2.6.3. Removed all codes of `SSL` to save memory (extra ~3K) since the HomeKit does not require SSL. Fix the memory-leak in `WiFiClinet.stop()` by adding `tcp_abandon(_pcb, 0)` in `stop()`, based on the idea of [esp8266/Arduino/pull/2767](https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino/pull/2767).

#### v1.0.1 
* Reduce `winsize` from `3` to `2`(same performance) to lower the heap required. Pairing can be done with low free-heap of ~14000.
* Specify the MDNS runs on the IPAddress of STA to ensure the HomeKit can work with some SoftAP-based WiFi-Config libraries.
* Rename the `HTTP_METHOD`(s) in `http_parser.h` to avoid multi-definition errors when using `ESP8266WebServer` together.
